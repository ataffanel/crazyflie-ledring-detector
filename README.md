Detects the position of a Crazyflie 2.0 using the Ledring deck as bright marker.

Designed to detect 4 white LEDs displayed at corners of a square by the led-ring.
The LED pattern is setup using the led-ring tab of the crazyflie-client.
A branch with an expos tab is used for the crazyflie-client: https://github.com/ataffanel/crazyflie-clients-python/tree/dev-extpos.
